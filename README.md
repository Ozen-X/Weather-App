Open index.html:
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Note: For the geolocation feature to work best, it is recommended to use a local server (like Live Server in VS Code) rather than opening the file directly.

⚙️ Configuration

The app uses WeatherAPI to fetch data.

Go to WeatherAPI.com and sign up for a free API key.

Open index.html in your code editor.

Locate the configuration section in the JavaScript:

// line ~170
